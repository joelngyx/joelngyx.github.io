      <p class="p-italics" style="text-align: center">That's me in the middle.</p>
      <p class="p-bold">About</p>
      <p>
        At Thales, I was assigned to a team that was responsible for building the Replayer Project. This was an 
        ongoing project with the Land Transport Authority (LTA), to create an desktop application. 
        This application would be used by LTA personnel to simulate railway activity along the North-East Line (NEL).
        Such simulations would be helpful for training LTA personnel in reacting to various circumstances.
      </p>
      <p class="p-bold">Contributions</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Developed the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the application with Python Tkiner. 
          The GUI was based on a design provided by another department. The GUI could be used to sort and upload log files 
          for simulations. Users could also view the time elapsed/remaining for ongoing simulations.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Contributed code to the application's middleware with C++. This was to interpret the log files uploaded, and 
          run simulations accurately.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Worked with my team to provide and implemented possible solutions to simulate railway activity. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Designed a solution that would provide LTA personnel the ability to set and synchronize the date and time on 
          all relevant servers when a simulation is being performed. Subsequently, I presented this solution to my 
          colleagues and superiors.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p-bold">Takeaways</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Picked up Python, and was able to use my existing C++ and Linux knowledge into practice in a professional
          workplace setting.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Learned about, and applied common software engineering practices, including some of the standard practices defined by the 
          Institute of Electical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Took part in my team's Agile workflow, by using Jira (an issue-tracking tool) and participating in bi-weekly sprints.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Had experience creating presentations about my work, and enunciating problems and possible solutions to my superiors.

      <h2>My experience as a Web Developer Intern at Tusitala Books</h2>
      <p class="p-bold">About</p>
      <p>
        At Tusitala Books, I developed microsites and web applications for the company's clients, based on the Figma prototypes
        developed by the company's designer. Some of the company's clients include Singapore HeritageFest and Esplanade. These 
        projects are mostly about creating digital experiences of local literary/art works.
      </p>
      <p class="p-bold">Contributions</p>
      <p>Development of the Second Edition of Esplanade's Little Red Comma</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Little Red Comma is a programme commissioned by Esplanade Offstage, and backed by the National Arts Council.
          The programme combines Singaporean literature with digital media.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Participated heavily in the development of 3 microsites in the second edition of the Little Red Comma. 
          I used Front-End technologies, such as React JS, Bootstrap and SASS.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Development of other web applications and microsites</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Developed and maintained the front-end of other projects, based on the client's feedback.</p></li>
        <li><p>Such tasks required me to utilize popular JavaScript libraries such as Mapbox GL JS, Howl JS, and A-Frame.</p></li>
        <li><p>Currently developing an Augmented Reality (AR) web application using 8th Wall.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p-bold">Takeaways</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Picked up many technologies used in Front-End Development, and was able to use them in a professional workplace
          setting, with considerable time constraints.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Further developed communication skills. This is via opportunities to participate in the ideation process 
          for the company's project pitches, and updating clients regarding the progress of the company's work. In addition, I helped 
          man the company's booth at the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH) Conference 2022, during which I explained
          the company's projects to other professionals at the conference.

      <p class="p-bold">Motivation</p>
      <p>
        This application was built with a team of 2. My team member and I found that speaking up in a lecture 
        to clarify doubts can be rather daunting, especially if one is fairly introverted. And even if we did voice our doubts,
        the act could be disruptive to our peers. We did notice that there were already various applications used by professors 
        in school for students to discuss and raise their doubts, such as Pigeonhole Live. However, these tools often came with 
        issues - most commonly, faulty links. QuerIt aims to solve this issue by allowing anyone with a mobile phone to simply enable 
        their GPS, and join the chatroom created by the speaker/professor/teaching assistant.
      </p>
      <p class="p-bold">Functionalities</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Users can sign in after creating an account, or anonymously, without creating an account.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Users can create a chatroom and set a distance, such that other users within this distance would be able to 
          join this chatroom. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Inside chatrooms, users can post threads. All users in the chatroom will be able to comment on the thread.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Users can upvote/downvote threads and comments in the chatroom they are currently in.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Users who are logged in with their accounts can archive comments for future reference.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p-bold">Trying out QuerIt</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, QuerIt only works on Android 10.0, a common version of Android when the application was developed.
        However, QuerIt can still run on an Android emulator with Android 10.0, or with an Android device with 
        Android 10.0. Download the .apk file through the "Download QuerIt" button below, and install it on an 
        Android emulator/device.

      <h2>HikingHelper</h2>
      <p class="p-bold">Motivation</p>
      <p>
        This high-fidelity prototype is of a hypothetical application that helps users discover, rate, and share new hiking trails
        with others. The prototype was the result of a multi-step design process, with required the practice of various User Interface
        /User Experience (UI/UX) principles.
      </p>
      <p class="p-bold">Design Process</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Ideation: this involved a brainstorm process that comprised of methods such as Crazy 8s (a fast sketching exercise to help
          generate ideas).
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          User research: we identified our idea's primary and secondary
          users. Based on our user identification process, we conducted user recruitment and user study. The latter involved
          the use of surveys on Google Forms and interviews over video call.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Identifying user tasks: based on the findings from the user study, we came up with user scenarios and tasks, which were
          then reflected in storyboards.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Low-fidelity Prototype: Balsamiq was used to quickly create Lo-Fi prototypes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          High-fidelity Prototype: Figma was used to create a hi-fi prototype, based on the best aspects of each member's Lo-Fi prototype.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          User testing: user testing with the hi-fi prototype was performed by conducting heuristic evaluation (with the teaching staff), 
          general usability testing (using Maze), and detailed usability testing, which involved participants using the prototype and 
          vocalizing their thought process over a Zoom call.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Improving the Hi-Fi prototype based on feedback and findings from user testing.
        </p></li>

      <h2>J'Apprend</h2>
      <p class="p-bold">Motivation</p>
      <p>
        This prototype was developed for the module's Individual Design Exercise. This hypothetical application would help 
        make learning the French language more effective.
      </p>
      <p class="p-bold">Design Process</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Design considerations: based on readings provided, I identified certain methods that make learning more effective.
          These methods are:
          <p>1) Adopting the harder-to-learn condition (English-to-French).</p>
          <p>
            2) Adopting immediate testing (after the user has just learned something new), followed by delayed tests.
            These tests should be open-ended.
          </p>
          <p>3) Lessons should be short.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Detailing the user journey: by detailing each step that a typical user would take when using this application, I am
          better able to identify potential issues experienced by users.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Sketching and Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi) prototyping using Balsamiq.</p></li>
        <li><p>
          High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) prototyping using Figma: I strived to use heuristic evaluation based on 
          Nelson's Heuristics. Some of the heuristics I adhered to are:
          <p>
            1) User control and freedom - users should be able to navigate the application easily, with as few 
            actions as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) Match between system and the real world - the application is modelled after flash cards, and there 
            terms used in the application are widely used.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) Aesthetic and minimalist design - the application has a simple colour scheme and does not have a cluttered design.
          </p>
        </p></li>

      <p class="p-bold">Motivation</p>
      <p>
        This project required a wheeled robot, controlled by an android application via a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection, 
        to traverse a course arranged by the teaching staff. In addition, the robot had to have functionalities such as: 
        <ul>
          <li><p>
            Having lights switch on and off in a particular order, according to the action being performed.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            Playing a soundtrack continuously.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            A self-driving mode where the robot has to navigate a small obstacle course without any intervention.
          </p></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The robot was built on a FRDM-KL25Z microcontroller, with CMSIS-RTOS RTX (a Real Time Operating System 
        interface for Cortex-M processor-based devices) for scheduling and threading.
      </p>
      <p class="p-bold">Contributions</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          Implemented a thread that was responsible for the lights on the robot. The lights had to blink in a 
          particular order based on the actions taken by the robot. For example, when the robot is stationary,
          all lights must be lighted up, and if the robot is not stationary, the front lights must flash in a 
          particular order, with a specified delay.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Contributed to the code for the IRQ (Interrupt Request) Handlers. IRQ Handlers allow the robot 
          to respond to detected signals from the hardware components (such as Ultrasonic Sensors).
